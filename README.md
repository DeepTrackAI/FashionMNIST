# FashionMNIST
Welcome to the GitHub page of DeepTrackAI's Fashion-MNIST dataset. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/)'s article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The authors intend `Fashion-MNIST` to serve as a direct **drop-in replacement** for the original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

### Labels
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | T-shirt/top |
| 1 | Trouser |
| 2 | Pullover |
| 3 | Dress |
| 4 | Coat |
| 5 | Sandal |
| 6 | Shirt |
| 7 | Sneaker |
| 8 | Bag |
| 9 | Ankle boot |
